# Abstract Interpretation Project

This is the public repository for my (Goktug Saatcioglu) Spring 2019 Abstract Interpretation Project. All implementations of the abstract domains are in the domains folder. The src folder contains the core parts of the project including the parser and the interpreter itself. Please see manual.pdf on how to run the project with a specific domain and how to provide test inputs.
